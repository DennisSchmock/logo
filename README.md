This project is inspired heavily by the Logo. The intention is, to create a real programming language that children of most ages
will be able to use.

At the moment it is in its earliest stage. There are some limited commands, you can declare functions, loops are supported and you can make
recursive calls. 

It is made with Swing GUI, but it will be ported to a HTML5 canvas using javascript and java.
